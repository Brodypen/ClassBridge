# ClassBridge
Welcome to classbridge, a phone app which its main focus is to bring financial literacy who come from low-income backgrounds and may lack access to proper education and opportunities. This product is meant for everyone including children and grown ups so they can learn together.

## Features

### :books: Courses
Users have the opportunity to explore a wide range of courses designed to enhance their current skill set while introducing them to new concepts and techniques. Each course is structured to cater to different learning styles. Whether users are looking to advance in a specific subject or explore something new, the course library offers resources for all levels of learning.

### :school_satchel: Homeworks
In this section, users can view a comprehensive list of their assigned homework, each categorized with details such as due dates, and priority levels. The homework dashboard is designed to provide clarity and organization, helping users keep track of their academic responsibilities.

### :trophy: Grades
Users can access their performance reports through the Grades section, where they can review detailed breakdowns of their scores for each completed assignment, quiz, and exam. This section allows students to stay up-to-date on their academic progress and see how they are doing in each course. 

### :bell: Reminders
The reminders section provides a convenient overview of the most pressing assignments and tasks. Users can quickly glance at their upcoming deadlines and high-priority homework to stay on top of their schedule. 

## Technologies

## :computer: Front-End
We utilized technologiez such as React Native, typescript, and Tailwind CSS, we use Figma for the design of the user interface as well as the use experience, all of this with the goal of having a product that everyone can access with ease.

## :computer: Back-End
For the backend with mainly used Firebase cloud, store datab base, as well as firebase functions. Also, we have made it so it it serverless which contributes to the cost efficiency of the project when trying to escalate it to the next level.

## :speaker: Support for multiple languages
We introduced a feature to give users the option to switch between their main languages, for the moment only english and spanish are inplemented.

A diagram of our backend and workflow can be found down below, this diagram was followed in order to get the app up and running, although as new ideas came to fruition we expanded beyond this diagram.
